The purpose of this product is to hold the data managed 
by the recycling promoters from 
[Polímeros Nacionales C.A.](http://www.polimerosnacionales.net/) in order to have an easy way to recover them and use them easily.

This product is in its first development stage.
Currently, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is being
developed.
